# Task 2 - Numbers (Beginner Level)

## Completed as part of Python Development Internship by Shadow Fox

### Objectives:
- Practice numeric data types and formatting in Python.
- Learn to work with mathematical formulas and real-world logic.
- Improve understanding of units and conversions.

### Tasks Completed:

1. **Formatted a number using the `format()` function with the `'o'` specifier:**
   - Converted the decimal number `145` into its octal representation using Python’s `format()` function.
   - Output: `221` (which is `145` in octal).

2. **Calculated the area of a circular pond and the total amount of water in liters:**
   - Radius of the pond: `84` meters.
   - Used the formula for the area of a circle: `Area = π × r²`, with π = `3.14`.
   - Calculated total water: `Area × 1.4` liters (1.4 liters per m²).
   - Output: Area = `22167.36` m², Total Water ≈ `31034` liters (rounded to integer).

3. **Calculated speed in meters per second:**
   - Distance = `490` meters, Time = `7` minutes.
   - Converted time to seconds and applied `Speed = Distance / Time`.
   - Output: Speed = `1` m/s (integer without decimals).

### Skills Practiced:
- Number formatting using `format()`.
- Arithmetic operations and mathematical formulas.
- Type casting and conversion.
