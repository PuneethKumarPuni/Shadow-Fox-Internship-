# Task 4: If Condition

## Completed as part of Python Development Internship by Shadow Fox

### Objective:
This task focuses on using conditional (`if-elif-else`) statements in Python to make decisions based on user input.


### Sub-Tasks:

#### 1. BMI Category Checker:
- **Inputs:** User enters height (in meters) and weight (in kg).
- **Calculation:** BMI is calculated using the formula: ( BMI = weight / (height ** 2) )

- **Conditions Used:**
- BMI >= 30 → "Obesity"
- 25 <= BMI < 30 → "Overweight"
- 18.5 <= BMI < 25 → "Normal"
- BMI < 18.5 → "Underweight"

#### 2. City-to-Country Mapping:
- **Inputs:** User enters a city name.
- **Data:** Predefined city lists for 3 countries:
- Australia: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth
- UAE: Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman
- India: Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi
- **Output:** Prints the country that the city belongs to.

#### 3. Same Country City Checker:
- **Inputs:** User enters two cities.
- **Functionality:**
- A function determines the country for each city.
- Compares the countries and prints:
  - "Both cities are in [Country]" if they match.
  - "They don't belong to the same country" otherwise.
  - Handles invalid cities.


### Python Concepts Practiced:
- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- List membership (`in` keyword)
- User input handling
- Custom function creation
- String formatting and conditional logic
