# Task 5: For Loop

## Completed as part of Python Development Internship by Shadow Fox

### Objective:
To practice using `for` loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python by simulating random events and managing iterative workout progress.


### Sub-Tasks:

#### 1. Die Roll Simulation:
- Simulated rolling a six-sided die 20 times using a `for` loop and `random.randint()`.
- Tracked and printed:
  - Number of times a 6 was rolled.
  - Number of times a 1 was rolled.
  - Number of times two 6s occurred consecutively.
- Printed each roll result to monitor the sequence.

#### 2. Jumping Jack Workout Tracker:
- Programmed a workout routine of 100 jumping jacks, performed in sets of 10.
- After each set, asked the user if they were tired.
- If tired, asked if they wanted to skip the remaining sets.
  - If yes, printed total jumping jacks completed and ended the workout.
  - If no, continued with the remaining sets.
- If user wasnâ€™t tired, continued until all 100 jumping jacks were completed.
- Printed congratulatory message upon completion.



### Python Concepts Practiced:
- `for` loops and iteration
- `while` loop for continuous input and control
- Use of the `random` module for simulating dice rolls
- Conditional statements with multiple branches
